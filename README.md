# Tech Interview Prep
This is a compilation of the problems I am solving this summer as I practice my technical interview problem solving skills.
My language of choice is Java, and the sources of these problems are HackerRank and LeetCode

## work in progress
Some ideas for this repo as I continue to add solutions I come up while I practice are to:
<ul>
<li>add the difficulty level of the problem </li>
<li>add sample input and the output gotten with the program</li>
<li>add comments on eficacy and how I can improve the solutions as I learn more</li>
</ul>
