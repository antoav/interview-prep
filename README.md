# Tech Interview Prep Problems (No Data Structures used)
This is a compilation of the problems I am solving this summer as I practice my technical interview problem solving skills.
My language of choice is Java, and the sources of these problems are HackerRank and LeetCode. These solutions do not cover any data structures given that I will be taking that class for the first time next semester. I will continue to update this repository with improved solutions and more advanced problems as I learn more concepts. 

## work in progress
Some ideas for this repo as I continue to add solutions I come up while I practice are to:
<ul>
<li>add the difficulty level of the problem </li>
<li>add sample input and the output gotten with the program</li>
<li>add comments on eficacy and how I can improve the solutions as I learn more</li>
</ul>
